#Perceptron


Used a perceptron with 785 inputs (which includes the bias input) and 10 outputs to learn to classify the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

Performing training on the perceptrons with three different learning rates: Î· = 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1.
